# InstaVision

This is a simple example project demonstrating the usage of Google Cloud’s Vision API and vue-picture-input, a mobile-friendly picture file input Vue.js component with image preview, drag and drop, and EXIF orientation. Google Cloud’s Vision API offers powerful pre-trained machine learning models through REST and RPC APIs. Assign labels to images and quickly classify them into millions of predefined categories. Detect objects and faces, read printed and handwritten text, and build valuable metadata into your image catalog.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
